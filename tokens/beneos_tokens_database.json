Their social behaviour is suprisingly complex, with them displaying their martial skills through ritualized combat among each other. However, if isolated from its pack, a Cipactli can form an equally strong bond with any creature able to gain the Cipactli's respect by demonstrating superior prowess. Indigenous tribes have been observed utilizing bonded Cipactli as status symbols, as well as beasts of burden or instruments of war. Tribal legends tell of champions riding into battle mounted on a rampaging Cipactli, battering aside enemies and jungle trees alike in a display of rage worthy of their eponymous genitor.",

Legend has them born from wind and water, which might explain their affinity to the sea. Colonies, or *parliaments*, of Harpyies can be often found nesting atop the salt-encrusted masts and rigging of beached shipwrecks. This behaviour unfortunately further feeds the hate and fear towards them, as they stand accused of gloating over the misfortune of others, when in reality Harpyies are inclined to protect shipwrecked sailors from actual malicious creatures like the alluring Sirens.",

Our Dragon makes no attempt at being an ambivalent creature, skirting the border of good and evil or trying to paint the picture of a complex and often misunderstood creature. This Dragon is a scaled tyrant, a megalomaniacal lizard corrupted by the arcane energies flowing through its veins. It is avaricious, gluttonous, wrathful and treacherous - the worst traits humanity can offer, but enabled by inhabiting a body of a living and breathing natural disaster.",

Dwarves are a proud and stubborn folk and while they appreciate the rigid structures of monarchy, they need a reason for why a specific individual should hold the power to rule the grand cave cities, vast mountain halls and stalwart hill fortresses of dwarvenkind. However, if an aspirant to the throne manages to endure the ordeals and rites necessary to claim the title of king, their subjects serve them with unwavering loyalty. Each Dwarven King is a statesman, general and master craftsman with a body of granite, a soul of iron and a heart of gold.",

      "description": "Shamans are the spiritual leaders of an orc warhost. They maintain the moral of the troops by conducting bonding rituals and are generally tasked with a wide array of ceremonial duties. Even though they are feared and respected, Shamans often are outsiders, as their reclusive nature and connection to the spiritual world warps them into capricious eccentrics. Most Shamans are not bound to any host, as their true loyalty lies with the shamanistic covens they belong to, often only supporting a host chief when their reign of terror furthers the Shamans own, often concealed, agenda. In combat, Shamans are fearsome opponents who may call upon forces of nature to bring their enemies to their knees. They are able to call upon aid from beyond the grave and inspire the troops surrounding them to fight even harder, as they feel their ancestor's gaze upon them.",

If they set foot onto a battlefield, their troops throw themselves every more recklessly at the enemy ranks, seeking the approval of their sovereign. Every trace of weakness must purged and every defeat could spell doom for an aspiring conqueror. This realisation often leaves War Chiefs paranoid and choleric, while their constant need to prove their might and tactical acumen drives them to ever greater bloodshed and destruction.",

Despite their harrowing appearance, Ossian Debt Collectors are courteous and sophisticated negotiators, blessed with the endless patience of the undead and prodigious language skills. When approaching a debtor, they initially aim on settling things amicably, politely asking the transient debtor to accompany them to the Ossian Bank to stand before the Tribunal. When met with unreasonableness or hostility, the Debt Collectors begrudgingly change tactics in favour of more direct means of apprehension. It is unclear if their skeletal appearance reflects a Collector's true being or if it only appears as such to their targets, combining two of the things mortals fear most: death and tax collectors.",

Their diet consists of everything unlucky enough to wander in front of its eponymous maw, supplemented by anything barely resembling actual prey - including mossy logs, mid-sized boulders or small vehicles. This leads to swamps and river banks within Shattermaw territory being lined with the wreckage of skiffs or rafts displaying their signature corrosive bite marks.",

This  makes them even more dangerous, as Gobblers fearlessly seek out the company of other beings to play with them - oftentimes accidently killing them in the process.
