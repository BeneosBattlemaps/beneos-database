They roam mangrove forests and tropical river banks in packs, behaving very territorial and highly aggressive towards any kind of encroachment. Their social behaviour is suprisingly complex, with them displaying their martial skills through ritualized combat among each other. However, if isolated from its pack, a Cipactli can form an equally strong bond with any creature able to gain the Cipactli's respect by demonstrating superior prowess. Indigenous tribes have been observed utilizing bonded Cipactli as status symbols, as well as beasts of burden or instruments of war. Tribal legends tell of champions riding into battle mounted on a rampaging Cipactli, battering aside enemies and jungle trees alike in a display of rage worthy of their eponymous genitor.",

Legend has them born from wind and water, which might explain their affinity to the sea. Colonies, or *parliaments*, of Harpyies can be often found nesting atop the salt-encrusted masts and rigging of beached shipwrecks. This behaviour unfortunately further feeds the hate and fear towards them, as they stand accused of gloating over the misfortune of others, when in reality Harpyies are inclined to protect shipwrecked sailors from actual malicious creatures like the alluring Sirens.",

      "description": "The Dragon might be the ultimate mythical creature. Almost every human culture has a being with the shared traits of a snake-like body, mighty wings, supernatural cunning and indomitable might. In some myths and folktales they are benevolent and wise, in most they are cruel and despotic. Our dragon makes no attempt at being an ambivalent creature, skirting the border of good and evil or trying to paint the picture of a complex and often misunderstood creature. This dragon is a scaled tyrant, a megalomaniacal lizard corrupted by the arcane energies flowing through its veins. It is avaricious, gluttonous, wrathful and treacherous - the worst traits humanity can offer, but enabled by inhabiting a body of a living and breathing natural disaster.",

However, if an aspirant to the throne manages to endure the ordeals and rites necessary to claim the title of king, their subjects serve them with unwavering loyalty. Each Dwarven King is a statesman, general and master craftsman with a body of granite, a soul of iron and a heart of gold.",

Their true form is hard to discern, as they are overgrown with a thick crust of mineral-rich sediment. This crust acts both as natural armor, as well as a rich source of nutrients for nearby flora and fauna. Reef Keepers are usually docile, but if they consider their chosen protectorate endangered they make use of a vast arsenal of exotic defensive capabilities",

Most Shamans are not bound to any host, as their true loyalty lies with the shamanistic covens they belong to, often only supporting a host chief when their reign of terror furthers the Shamans own, often concealed, agenda. In combat, Shamans are fearsome opponents who may call upon forces of nature to bring their enemies to their knees. They are able to call upon aid from beyond the grave and inspire the troops surrounding them to fight even harder, as they feel their ancestor's gaze upon them.",

But add a few hundred or even thousand bats, and you're suddenly confronted with a shrieking inferno of razor claws and pointy teeth, able to gnaw any humanoid the meat from its bones by sheer mass of bodies. Now, regular swarms of bats normally don't show signs of aggression towards beings larger than their insect prey. But in a world steeped in dark magic and beset by evil forces, bats can become dangerous creatures, revelling in a vampiric nature normally only shown by a few select subspecies of bats. These bloodthirsty swarms of bats darken the moonlight sky with ominous intent and are said to only leave drained husks in their wake...",

She is an ambitious monarch and often has her court venture out into the realm of man to bring unnatural winter in their wake. Although some claim to have bested or even slain her, tales of her defeat are often followed by even more frigid devastation at the hands of the vengeful queen of ice. With the utterly devoted Knights of Winter sworn to her service, she is considered one of the most enigmatic, yet powerful of the fair lords and ladies.",

Their garishly coloured, lumpy and spongy skin hides toxin glands which release a quickly evaporating colour- and odorless toxin that, upon skin contact or inhalation, leads to harrowing pain, long lasting paralysis and even death. Due to this feature, Gobblers have almost no natural predators, causing them to generally act carefree, curious and playful. This  makes them even more dangerous, as Gobblers fearlessly seek out the company of other beings to play with them - oftentimes accidently killing them in the process.  Some assume the toxiCity to be a result of the Gobbler's diet, raising the question on what on earth Gobblers are eating.",

Bog Striders are attracted to their prey by ripples in the murky water, using their front legs as sensors for the vibrations. The Bog Strider aims to puncture its prey's body with its proboscis and injects acidic saliva that liquifies the innards, sucking out the resulting fluid. Due to their low intelligence and high dependency on pheromonal markings, they can be controlled with special pheromonal cocktails, making them ideal mounts for traversing wetlands.",

The surrounding realms where powerless against the god-beasts otherworldly might and divine wrath and soon an empire was carved from bone, blood and sand with mighty monuments of worship rising from the desert ground wherever the slave-armies of Ankh marched. The god-beasts were cast down using the cthonian Duat Blades, their wielders were lauded as heroes and ruled Ankh for ages, their lifespan unnaturally extended by the cursed blades. As they eventually died, they would rise again and reclaim their blades, their embalmed and mummified bodies serving as hollow vessels for the energies of the Duat. Legions of shambling mummies follow in their wake, once more called to war by their queens and princes, now waging war on their own erstwhile kin-blood.",

But the great dragon resisted and as punishment they psychically flayed him, stripping away his indomitable scales and reducing his form to a mass of undulating flesh.His body flayed and defiled, his mind fractured in unmendable ways, the broken husk of Sharakhul rose from the depths and sought exile, pouring himself into foul methods of blood magic in a desperate attempt to mend his flesh and restore his scales",

Similarly, unclear is how Mimics reproduce, even if the thought of pocket-sized chests with big eyes is delightful.

There is no place for ego, grudges or feuds, as time is better spent improving the ever slim chances of the tribe’s survival than to indulge in petty conflicts. Some goblins chafe under this, for reasons of temper, personality or sheer stubborn obstinacy. A Raid Rabble is a great way to send these Rabble-Rousers to blow off some steam, before they start developing some dangerous thoughts. This is a win-win situation, as they make for furious warriors, passionate looters and grandstanding braggarts, taking their attention away from getting into trouble, continuously telling of their heroic deeds instead. That is, if they return.",

They do this to take note of where this particular soul goes, to eventually drag it back to fulfill various purposes, should the need arise. Necessity is the mother of invention, goblins die in droves - why not capitalise on that? The goblins are thankful for their ancestor’s service and both live and die knowing that their duty does not end in death. A Shaman’s word carries a lot of weight, as they are known to converse with the spirits of the afterlife and carry the knowledge of the ancestors. Most shamans however quickly find out that dying does not automatically impart knowledge and most ancestors are as dense in death as they were in life. This realisation usually sours a Soulshaper Shaman’s mood and factors into their characteristic bitterness.",

These prototypes are bristling with experimental weaponry and are designed for boarding actions within the tight confines of Airship corridors, being able to block off parts of the ship with geomantic hard-light barriers or act as a spearhead to breach fortified positions.

Called Skoldbærer in their native tongue, fables claim that Stonegorgers devour rock and stone to get to the gems, ores and minerals within in an attempt to reunite their earthen mother with her treasures. Accumulating these precious materials within their bodies, they slowly turn into stone themselves. As they approach the end of their life, they seek ever greater depths, finally succumbing to age and pressure, returning earth’s treasures to its womb. The earth welcomes its wayward children back and gracefully accepts the gifts they bring, rewarding the Stonegorger by slowly turning it into a being of pure diamond, in death finally achieving the beauty it always pursued.",

Those worrying about their immortal soul may be relieved to hear that the actual Apshait much prefer to feast on mortal bodies instead, making them a dangerous prospect for both lone travelers or armed transports traversing infested landscapes. Breeding in looming underground hives, the Asphait’s expansive tunnel networks stretch far beyond the central hive chambers, where the Apshait soldier swarms utilize them to coordinate intricate ambushes.",

Not to be confused with the mindless shambling hordes of lesser undead they often command, they are creative in the way of using their undead form to their advantage, amplifying their martial strength with the possibilities opened up by an undying body. Their fiery passion and warrior’s honour, however, transformed into the cruel coldness of the unliving, turning the Graveblades into relentless executors of calculated and methodical slaughter.",

Everyone can petition the Abbey to seek vengeance for unjust transgressions, abuse of power or breaking of chivalrous oaths. If the petition is granted, the Blackfeather Hunt is called and a pair of Huntressess seeks out their knightly prey.",

Characteristic of Azure Dragon-Sages is the pursuit of freedom for all peoples, and their arrival often heralds revolution and reformation.

It is common for a mature Carnax to seek an equal opponent in battle and, should they prove worthy, submit to them, forming a martial bond in and out of combat, mutually learning from one another as battle brothers, mutuals and mounts.

Bad weather, lack of food or the confrontation with a superior opponent can spell certain death for a whole pack. And even those who narrowly escape death may succumb to the hardships of the wilderness. But some adapt to a life of solitude. Their constant fight for survival shapes them to be more ferocious in combat and forces them to rely on their keen senses even more. They develop a sharper instinct for survival and become more cunning than their pack-hunting kin, often stalking their chosen prey for days before deciding on the ideal moment to strike.",
