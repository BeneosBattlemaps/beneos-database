      "description": "Sometimes Vampires impart the dubious gift of spawndom upon the wrong soul, stirring primordial horrors from their sleep. These vampire spawns regress to a primal state, detached from the rules that even compel their creators, driven only by their lust for terror and agony.  Primal Spawns are beyond their unwilling creators' control and they in turn feel disdain for their more â€˜evolvedâ€™ kin. Despite not having a weakness to sunlight, they prefer the shadows, as the darkness supports their preferred hunting style. And if the right opportunity arises, a Primal Vampire Spawn will not hesitate to hunt during broad daylight to indulge in the screams of horrified onlookers.",

In the context of adventuring, Horses are mainly used for travel and battle, although they may as well become trusted and loved companions to the players. This reimagination of the classic Horse embodies a sturdy and valiant creature able to support it's party on arduous voyages as well as dire combat scenarios.",

However, if isolated from its pack, a Cipactli can form an equally strong bond with any creature able to gain the Cipactli's respect by demonstrating superior prowess. Indigenous tribes have been observed utilizing bonded Cipactli as status symbols, as well as beasts of burden or instruments of war. Tribal legends tell of champions riding into battle mounted on a rampaging Cipactli, battering aside enemies and jungle trees alike in a display of rage worthy of their eponymous genitor.",

Legend has them born from wind and water, which might explain their affinity to the sea.

Our Dragon makes no attempt at being an ambivalent creature, skirting the border of good and evil or trying to paint the picture of a complex and often misunderstood creature.

Most Shamans are not bound to any host, as their true loyalty lies with the shamanistic covens they belong to, often only supporting a host chief when their reign of terror furthers the Shamans own, often concealed, agenda. In combat, Shamans are fearsome opponents who may call upon forces of nature to bring their enemies to their knees.

      "description": "Where the azure sky and the lush green of viridian grasslands meet, the Kentauroi reign without equal. They are the undisputed lords of vast plains, steppes, taigas or savannahs. Being nomadic and reclusive, most live in tribal herd-clans, eternally roaming the sacred lands of their forebearers. But there are tales from the eastern fringes, describing hordes of Kentauroi coming together under the banners of a Great Khan, blocking out the skies with thousands of arrows and grinding villages, armies and fortress gates into the dust below their hooves.",

When approaching a debtor, they initially aim on settling things amicably, politely asking the transient debtor to accompany them to the Ossian Bank to stand before the Tribunal. When met with unreasonableness or hostility, the Debt Collectors begrudgingly change tactics in favour of more direct means of apprehension. It is unclear if their skeletal appearance reflects a Collector's true being or if it only appears as such to their targets, combining two of the things mortals fear most: death and tax collectors.",

Still wrapped in the tattered and blood splattered remains of their wedding gowns, Mournbrides haunt places of great significance to the departed individual, like their family home, wedding venue or secret a meeting place with their former beloved.

Their thick leathery skin mirrors the swamp-green of their habitat and their cragged shells and bone protrusions become eventually overgrown by moss, algae and lichens, making Shattermaws surprisingly difficult to notice. Their diet consists of everything unlucky enough to wander in front of its eponymous maw, supplemented by anything barely resembling actual prey - including mossy logs, mid-sized boulders or small vehicles. This leads to swamps and river banks within Shattermaw territory being lined with the wreckage of skiffs or rafts displaying their signature corrosive bite marks.",

Due to this feature, Gobblers have almost no natural predators, causing them to generally act carefree, curious and playful. This  makes them even more dangerous, as Gobblers fearlessly seek out the company of other beings to play with them - oftentimes accidently killing them in the process.  Some assume the toxicity to be a result of the Gobbler's diet, raising the question on what on earth Gobblers are eating.",

They are the terror of the wilderness incarnate, primal fear given a gangly shape and raking claws. Their true origin remains unknown, but some cultures perceive them to be spirits of hunger and greed, possessing avaricious individuals and turning them into the ferocious predators that stalk dark woods and bleak frontiers, hunting and devouring their former kin. Wendigos are swift and silent hunters, terrifying stalkers and savage butchers, capable of outmaneuvering and outsmarting even well-armed and steadfast groups of adventurers before unleashing upon them a terrifying display of primal carnage, leaving red snow in their wake, as they adorn their hunting grounds with grisly trophies.",

Bog Striders are attracted to their prey by ripples in the murky water, using their front legs as sensors for the vibrations. The Bog Strider aims to puncture its prey's body with its proboscis and injects acidic saliva that liquifies the innards, sucking out the resulting fluid. Due to their low intelligence and high dependency on pheromonal markings, they can be controlled with special pheromonal cocktails, making them ideal mounts for traversing wetlands.",

While their stiff movements appear predictable, incautious opponents often find themselves blocked in by an unending barrage of precise Greatsword blows.
