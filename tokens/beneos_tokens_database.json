Their social behaviour is suprisingly complex, with them displaying their martial skills through ritualized combat among each other. However, if isolated from its pack, a Cipactli can form an equally strong bond with any creature able to gain the Cipactli's respect by demonstrating superior prowess. Indigenous tribes have been observed utilizing bonded Cipactli as status symbols, as well as beasts of burden or instruments of war. Tribal legends tell of champions riding into battle mounted on a rampaging Cipactli, battering aside enemies and jungle trees alike in a display of rage worthy of their eponymous genitor.",

Legend has them born from wind and water, which might explain their affinity to the sea. Colonies, or *parliaments*, of Harpyies can be often found nesting atop the salt-encrusted masts and rigging of beached shipwrecks. This behaviour unfortunately further feeds the hate and fear towards them, as they stand accused of gloating over the misfortune of others, when in reality Harpyies are inclined to protect shipwrecked sailors from actual malicious creatures like the alluring Sirens.",

Our dragon makes no attempt at being an ambivalent creature, skirting the border of good and evil or trying to paint the picture of a complex and often misunderstood creature. This dragon is a scaled tyrant, a megalomaniacal lizard corrupted by the arcane energies flowing through its veins. It is avaricious, gluttonous, wrathful and treacherous - the worst traits humanity can offer, but enabled by inhabiting a body of a living and breathing natural disaster.",

Dwarves are a proud and stubborn folk and while they appreciate the rigid structures of monarchy, they need a reason for why a specific individual should hold the power to rule the grand cave cities, vast mountain halls and stalwart hill fortresses of dwarvenkind. However, if an aspirant to the throne manages to endure the ordeals and rites necessary to claim the title of king, their subjects serve them with unwavering loyalty. Each Dwarven King is a statesman, general and master craftsman with a body of granite, a soul of iron and a heart of gold.",

      "description": "Shamans are the spiritual leaders of an orc warhost. They maintain the moral of the troops by conducting bonding rituals and are generally tasked with a wide array of ceremonial duties. Even though they are feared and respected, Shamans often are outsiders, as their reclusive nature and connection to the spiritual world warps them into capricious eccentrics. Most Shamans are not bound to any host, as their true loyalty lies with the shamanistic covens they belong to, often only supporting a host chief when their reign of terror furthers the Shamans own, often concealed, agenda. In combat, Shamans are fearsome opponents who may call upon forces of nature to bring their enemies to their knees. They are able to call upon aid from beyond the grave and inspire the troops surrounding them to fight even harder, as they feel their ancestor's gaze upon them.",

If they set foot onto a battlefield, their troops throw themselves every more recklessly at the enemy ranks, seeking the approval of their sovereign. Every trace of weakness must purged and every defeat could spell doom for an aspiring conqueror. This realisation often leaves War Chiefs paranoid and choleric, while their constant need to prove their might and tactical acumen drives them to ever greater bloodshed and destruction.",

But add a few hundred or even thousand bats, and you're suddenly confronted with a shrieking inferno of razor claws and pointy teeth, able to gnaw any humanoid the meat from its bones by sheer mass of bodies. Now, regular swarms of bats normally don't show signs of aggression towards beings larger than their insect prey. But in a world steeped in dark magic and beset by evil forces, bats can become dangerous creatures, revelling in a vampiric nature normally only shown by a few select subspecies of bats. These bloodthirsty swarms of bats darken the moonlight sky with ominous intent and are said to only leave drained husks in their wake...",

Great tragedy usually surrounds a Mournbride's ermergence, like murder at the hands of a jealous rival or the taking of ones own life after being left at the altar. Still wrapped in the tattered and blood splattered remains of their wedding gowns, Mournbrides haunt places of great significance to the departed individual, like their family home, wedding venue or secret a meeting place with their former beloved. If their would-be spouse is still alive, the Mournbride will jealously watch over them, often causing more harm than good in their twisted need to protect them.",

Their thick leathery skin mirrors the swamp-green of their habitat and their cragged shells and bone protrusions become eventually overgrown by moss, algae and lichens, making Shattermaws surprisingly difficult to notice. Their diet consists of everything unlucky enough to wander in front of its eponymous maw, supplemented by anything barely resembling actual prey - including mossy logs, mid-sized boulders or small vehicles. This leads to swamps and river banks within Shattermaw territory being lined with the wreckage of skiffs or rafts displaying their signature corrosive bite marks.",

Due to this feature, Gobblers have almost no natural predators, causing them to generally act carefree, curious and playful. This  makes them even more dangerous, as Gobblers fearlessly seek out the company of other beings to play with them - oftentimes accidently killing them in the process.

Their true origin remains unknown, but some cultures perceive them to be spirits of hunger and greed, possessing avaricious individuals and turning them into the ferocious predators that stalk dark woods and bleak frontiers, hunting and devouring their former kin. Wendigos are swift and silent hunters, terrifying stalkers and savage butchers, capable of outmaneuvering and outsmarting even well-armed and steadfast groups of adventurers before unleashing upon them a terrifying display of primal carnage, leaving red snow in their wake, as they adorn their hunting grounds with grisly trophies.",

      "description": "Beckoning Devil's are favoured courtiers of the Father of Lies, one of the ruling Devils of the Nine Hells. With their seductive and corrupting powers, they seek to gain control over groups of powerful individuals to drive them into ruin, only to finally offer them salvation in their Lord's service. They possess a malign intelligence and relish their dark purpose, drawing great pleasure from the hunt. Once fixated on future servants worthy of their Lord, Beckoning Devils are relentless stalkers, quickly forcing their prey to question their sanity, as their paranoia swells and memories become unreliable. Those dominated by the Devil they are finally forced to commit harrowing atrocities, until they are left with no choice but to bow their knee to the dark patron of Lies. ",

      "description": "The unusual beings dubbed Grey Pilgrims wander the realms in search for enlightenment, be it in solitude, be it accompanied by disciples or mentors of their own choosing. Each of them has been given form by divine hands, created to study as much as to teach. They continuously reflect on the principles of divinity, the cosmos and the nature of mortality, each Pilgrim eventually reaching their own conclusion, before imparting their knowledge unto worthy souls and returning to the side of their creator. While on their journey, they go out of their way to inspire the ambition and resolve of those burdened by strife and suffering..",
