Their social behaviour is suprisingly complex, with them displaying their martial skills through ritualized combat among each other. However, if isolated from its pack, a Cipactli can form an equally strong bond with any creature able to gain the Cipactli's respect by demonstrating superior prowess. Indigenous tribes have been observed utilizing bonded Cipactli as status symbols, as well as beasts of burden or instruments of war. Tribal legends tell of champions riding into battle mounted on a rampaging Cipactli, battering aside enemies and jungle trees alike in a display of rage worthy of their eponymous genitor.",

Legend has them born from wind and water, which might explain their affinity to the sea. Colonies, or *parliaments*, of Harpyies can be often found nesting atop the salt-encrusted masts and rigging of beached shipwrecks. This behaviour unfortunately further feeds the hate and fear towards them, as they stand accused of gloating over the misfortune of others, when in reality Harpyies are inclined to protect shipwrecked sailors from actual malicious creatures like the alluring Sirens.",

Our dragon makes no attempt at being an ambivalent creature, skirting the border of good and evil or trying to paint the picture of a complex and often misunderstood creature. This dragon is a scaled tyrant, a megalomaniacal lizard corrupted by the arcane energies flowing through its veins. It is avaricious, gluttonous, wrathful and treacherous - the worst traits humanity can offer, but enabled by inhabiting a body of a living and breathing natural disaster.",

Bad weather, lack of food or the confrontation with a superior opponent can spell certain death for a whole pack. And even those who narrowly escape death may succumb to the hardships of the wilderness. But some adapt to a life of solitude. Their constant fight for survival shapes them to be more ferocious in combat and forces them to rely on their keen senses even more. They develop a sharper instinct for survival and become more cunning than their pack-hunting kin, often stalking their chosen prey for days before deciding on the ideal moment to strike.",

However, if an aspirant to the throne manages to endure the ordeals and rites necessary to claim the title of king, their subjects serve them with unwavering loyalty.

      "description": "Reef Keepers manifest around hydrothermal vents and venture the sea bed in search of untouched subnautic ecosystems like lush coral reefs or kelp forests, where they guard the native lifeforms against invasive species or destructive unnatural forces. Their true form is hard to discern, as they are overgrown with a thick crust of mineral-rich sediment. This crust acts both as natural armor, as well as a rich source of nutrients for nearby flora and fauna. Reef Keepers are usually docile, but if they consider their chosen protectorate endangered they make use of a vast arsenal of exotic defensive capabilities",

They maintain the moral of the troops by conducting bonding rituals and are generally tasked with a wide array of ceremonial duties. Even though they are feared and respected, Shamans often are outsiders, as their reclusive nature and connection to the spiritual world warps them into capricious eccentrics. Most Shamans are not bound to any host, as their true loyalty lies with the shamanistic covens they belong to, often only supporting a host chief when their reign of terror furthers the Shamans own, often concealed, agenda. In combat, Shamans are fearsome opponents who may call upon forces of nature to bring their enemies to their knees. They are able to call upon aid from beyond the grave and inspire the troops surrounding them to fight even harder, as they feel their ancestor's gaze upon them.",

But add a few hundred or even thousand bats, and you're suddenly confronted with a shrieking inferno of razor claws and pointy teeth, able to gnaw any humanoid the meat from its bones by sheer mass of bodies. Now, regular swarms of bats normally don't show signs of aggression towards beings larger than their insect prey. But in a world steeped in dark magic and beset by evil forces, bats can become dangerous creatures, revelling in a vampiric nature normally only shown by a few select subspecies of bats. These bloodthirsty swarms of bats darken the moonlight sky with ominous intent and are said to only leave drained husks in their wake...",

Despite their harrowing appearance, Ossian Debt Collectors are courteous and sophisticated negotiators, blessed with the endless patience of the undead and prodigious language skills. When approaching a debtor, they initially aim on settling things amicably, politely asking the transient debtor to accompany them to the Ossian Bank to stand before the Tribunal. When met with unreasonableness or hostility, the Debt Collectors begrudgingly change tactics in favour of more direct means of apprehension. It is unclear if their skeletal appearance reflects a Collector's true being or if it only appears as such to their targets, combining two of the things mortals fear most: death and tax collectors.",

Their diet consists of everything unlucky enough to wander in front of its eponymous maw, supplemented by anything barely resembling actual prey - including mossy logs, mid-sized boulders or small vehicles. This leads to swamps and river banks within Shattermaw territory being lined with the wreckage of skiffs or rafts displaying their signature corrosive bite marks.",

This  makes them even more dangerous, as Gobblers fearlessly seek out the company of other beings to play with them - oftentimes accidently killing them in the process.

      "description": "Shell-Sages wander the lands oblivious to possible danger, protected only by their trusty shell, sheer legendary luck and the hesitation of possible predators, as their would-be prey moves through their territory with confusing self-assuredness and tranquility. Shell-Sages owe their title to the habit of withdrawing into the safety of their eponymous shell, spending days and even weeks in deep contemplation, from which they they only awake due to the excitement experienced by stumbling upon especially profound insights. Wild animals or curious people are drawn to the shell, listening to the calming, mumbled utterances echoing from within the shell.",

How we ended up with the voracious ambush predators taking all manner of shapes or for ms still poses some unanswered questions. Similarly, unclear is how Mimics reproduce, even if the thought of pocket-sized chests with big eyes is delightful.

They do this to take note of where this particular soul goes, to eventually drag it back to fulfill various purposes, should the need arise. Necessity is the mother of invention, goblins die in droves - why not capitalise on that? The goblins are thankful for their ancestor’s service and both live and die knowing that their duty does not end in death. A Shaman’s word carries a lot of weight, as they are known to converse with the spirits of the afterlife and carry the knowledge of the ancestors. Most shamans however quickly find out that dying does not automatically impart knowledge and most ancestors are as dense in death as they were in life. This realisation usually sours a Soulshaper Shaman’s mood and factors into their characteristic bitterness.",

It is also unknown what causes life to spark within the overgrown form of the Reliquary, causing it to rise and wander. Maybe the souls of the ancient blades thirst for battle once more, or maybe the lost deity itself slowly wakes from its god-slumber, sending out these living shrines as solemn emissaries to seek out worthy warriors to receive the old god’s favor.",
