Despite their ferocity, they are more complex than their bestial appearance and a cursory assessment of their behaviour lets on. It is common for a mature Carnax to seek an equal opponent in battle and, should they prove worthy, submit to them, forming a martial bond in and out of combat, mutually learning from one another as battle brothers, mutuals and mounts. Warriors able to forge such a bond with a Carnax often attain legendary renown, and the power of such a mighty ally often allows them to naturally or violently rise to the top of their respective hierarchical structures.",

Wintergrim are murderous fey creatures and intrude into the profane world during a time where the temperature drops to unnatural lows and the snow mantle becomes a burial shroud for humans and livestock alike. Hunters don\u0027t return from the forest, rime coats windows and even a fire\u0027s heat may no longer banish the exisential cold that has seeped into body and spirit. Until banished by the return of spring, the Wintergrim will hunt, its pale bestial hands choking life and and warmth from its victims, leaving behind only icy skin and blood on the snow. At the seasonal height of its power, even powerful iron wards may not keep a Wintergrim at bay and many a frontier village turns to ancient pacts sealed with blood and sacrifice instead.",

Seeking a new vessel for their abominable hive mind, they spend decades torturing the dragon into submission, bent on erasing his spirit, originally intent on leaving the body intact. But the great dragon resisted and as punishment they psychically flayed him, stripping away his indomitable scales and reducing his form to a mass of undulating flesh.His body flayed and defiled, his mind fractured in unmendable ways, the broken husk of Sharakhul rose from the depths and sought exile, pouring himself into foul methods of blood magic in a desperate attempt to mend his flesh and restore his scales",

There is no place for ego, grudges or feuds, as time is better spent improving the ever slim chances of the tribe\u0027s survival than to indulge in petty conflicts. Some goblins chafe under this, for reasons of temper, personality or sheer stubborn obstinacy. A Raid Rabble is a great way to send these Rabble-Rousers to blow off some steam, before they start developing some dangerous thoughts. This is a win-win situation, as they make for furious warriors, passionate looters and grandstanding braggarts, taking their attention away from getting into trouble, continuously telling of their heroic deeds instead. That is, if they return.",

They are single-mindedly focused on living out their faith and will stop at nothing, least of all potential death, to stand up for what they perceive as divine truth.",

Acolytes of Murder represent a variant of these cultists, either already acting as the executive organs of their dark patrons or still in the process of proselytizing by joining armies, bandit gangs, or other seedy professions where they put their penchant for brutality and bloodshed to good use. Over time, they undergo subtle transformations, gaining inhuman traits like overgrown fangs, bloodshot, bestial eyes, or snarling snouts. They then seek out or return to the cult and act in unison with their kind, shedding blood and carrying out their patrons\u0027 bidding.",

They have created cosmic disciplines that tap into the deconstructive power of complete negation and null-essence to obliterate beings, magic, or even space itself, leaving gaping wounds in reality and motes of dust weightlessly drifting before dispersing, their origin soon to be forgotten by an unfeeling universe.",

This may be related to religious structures, general prejudices, or well-founded fears regarding those who wield such incomprehensible power for many. Witch Hunters must possess strong wills and pursue their mission with nigh-fanatical devotion, otherwise, they can hardly hope to counteract the manifold magical powers with mundane means, be they subtle or obvious. Their work often drives them to the edge of morality and sometimes beyond, and many break under the responsibility that rests on their shoulders - making them particularly dangerous for those who seek to harm no one with their craft but still find themselves in the hunter\u0027s sights.",

They roam mangrove forests and tropical river banks in packs, behaving very territorial and highly aggressive towards any kind of encroachment.

However, if isolated from its pack, a Cipactli can form an equally strong bond with any creature able to gain the Cipactli\u0027s respect by demonstrating superior prowess. Indigenous tribes have been observed utilizing bonded Cipactli as status symbols, as well as beasts of burden or instruments of war. Tribal legends tell of champions riding into battle mounted on a rampaging Cipactli, battering aside enemies and jungle trees alike in a display of rage worthy of their eponymous genitor.",

They do this to take note of where this particular soul goes, to eventually drag it back to fulfill various purposes, should the need arise. Necessity is the mother of invention, goblins die in droves - why not capitalise on that? The goblins are thankful for their ancestor\u0027s service and both live and die knowing that their duty does not end in death. A Shaman\u0027s word carries a lot of weight, as they are known to converse with the spirits of the afterlife and carry the knowledge of the ancestors. Most shamans however quickly find out that dying does not automatically impart knowledge and most ancestors are as dense in death as they were in life. This realisation usually sours a Soulshaper Shaman\u0027s mood and factors into their characteristic bitterness.",

The lords of the realm are in constant warfare, their mortal troops long expended. Unyielding, relentless soldiers were formed from volcanic rock and embers of the Primordial Flame. Soon the Scorched Legionaries waged eternal war on their masters behalf, their conflicts soon encroaching onto the mortal realms. They are devastating heavy infantry, blindly following their master\u0027s commands, untiring and without mercy. Many a desperate sovereign turns to the lords of the Fire Realm as a means to aquire the might of the Legion for their own purpose, not knowing, that by doing so they may doom the very realm they try to protect or conquer.",

As journeymen that have not yet passed their master\u0027s examination, they don\u0027t have access to the most choice resources from the Host\u0027s Limbchambers, Fleshpits and charnel houses. Instead, they have to scavenge battlefields or undertake personal raids in search of suitable parts for their projects. However, this makes them flexible and pragmatic improvisers who don\u0027t shy away from using less subtle and monstrous grafts, a practice frowned upon in the upper castes. Eager to practice advanced techniques on themselves, they are easily recognizable by their mismatched limbs, hulking statue and gruff demeanor.",

For Spooktober 2021 we decided to give the iconic Vampire Spawns roaming the crypts and castles of Curse of Strahd a unique spin! The Barovian Vampire spawn is closely bonded to Strahd, who is the land himself, as we all know! This is reflected by increased mental stats and a strange symbiotic relationship with the mist that wreathes it\u0027s masters domain, granting a formidable foe even more power and making for a creature able to haunt even veteran players\u0027 nightmares!",

Their garishly coloured, lumpy and spongy skin hides toxin glands which release a quickly evaporating colour- and odorless toxin that, upon skin contact or inhalation, leads to harrowing pain, long lasting paralysis and even death. Due to this feature, Gobblers have almost no natural predators, causing them to generally act carefree, curious and playful. This  makes them even more dangerous, as Gobblers fearlessly seek out the company of other beings to play with them - oftentimes accidently killing them in the process.  Some assume the toxiCity to be a result of the Gobbler\u0027s diet, raising the question on what on earth Gobblers are eating.",

Once the incursion is completed, they begin their hunt for raw arcane energy, usually starting with the unlucky caster of the spell that lured the Incursor into their world. Arcane Incursors usually hunt alone, but a sufficiently great source of magic might draw more specimens, marking the beginning of an infestation with catastrophic prospects for the local mage population.",

The surrounding realms where powerless against the god-beasts otherworldly might and divine wrath and soon an empire was carved from bone, blood and sand with mighty monuments of worship rising from the desert ground wherever the slave-armies of Ankh marched. The god-beasts were cast down using the cthonian Duat Blades, their wielders were lauded as heroes and ruled Ankh for ages, their lifespan unnaturally extended by the cursed blades. As they eventually died, they would rise again and reclaim their blades, their embalmed and mummified bodies serving as hollow vessels for the energies of the Duat. Legions of shambling mummies follow in their wake, once more called to war by their queens and princes, now waging war on their own erstwhile kin-blood.",

Called Skoldborer in their native tongue, fables claim that Stonegorgers devour rock and stone to get to the gems, ores and minerals within in an attempt to reunite their earthen mother with her treasures. Accumulating these precious materials within their bodies, they slowly turn into stone themselves. As they approach the end of their life, they seek ever greater depths, finally succumbing to age and pressure, returning earth\u0027s treasures to its womb. The earth welcomes its wayward children back and gracefully accepts the gifts they bring, rewarding the Stonegorger by slowly turning it into a being of pure diamond, in death finally achieving the beauty it always pursued.",

However, its developers notice with increasing concern that Mother Base units start to develop close bonds with their pilots and crew over time, even behaving irrationally, acting outside of permitted protocol or in other ways considered impossible to protect or even avenge their attached unit.",

Nothing embodies the cruelty and danger of untamed Wilderness as well as the Wendigo. They are the terror of the Wilderness incarnate, primal fear given a gangly shape and raking claws. Their true origin remains unknown, but some cultures perceive them to be spirits of hunger and greed, possessing avaricious individuals and turning them into the ferocious predators that stalk dark woods and bleak frontiers, hunting and devouring their former kin. Wendigos are swift and silent hunters, terrifying stalkers and savage butchers, capable of outmaneuvering and outsmarting even well-armed and steadfast groups of adventurers before unleashing upon them a terrifying display of primal carnage, leaving red snow in their wake, as they adorn their hunting grounds with grisly trophies.",

Every trace of weakness must purged and every defeat could spell doom for an aspiring conqueror. This realisation often leaves War Chiefs paranoid and choleric, while their constant need to prove their might and tactical acumen drives them to ever greater bloodshed and destruction.",

Death is a strong metaphysical concept and those tapping into the domain of biological and metaphysical death quickly find themselves swelling with power, as they carry life into the realms of death to reanimate bodies or manipulate souls, or invite death into the realms of the living, turning flesh to dust and withering body and soul. This power quickly corrupts and many societies fear, shun or hunt those who passed the treshold and invited death into their life.",

Heralded by the buzzing of bloated flies, the Burial Host descends upon cities or countryside alike, overwhelming even the sturdiest defenses in an unending onslaught of rotten flesh and rusted blades. Gaps within the ranks of the host are quickly filled, as the war machinery grinds forward, a self-serving and self-sustaining perpetuum Mobile of death and rebirth. Undead Pikemen form the front rows of the Host, forcing their enemies into exasperating wars of attrition",

Promising candidates are singled out from their brood mates early on, undergoing harrowing psycho-indoctrination to increase their resistances to various poisons and toxins, hone their inherent hypnotic abilities and trigger the transformation into a even more snake-like being. Due to their unique talents they become excellent operatives, making Poison Fangs ideal tools for political assassinations, terror campaigns or insidious purges within the own ranks.",

A cult leader may claim to know the way for a while, but not every acolyte will remain satisfied with that indefinitely. Cult Oracles receive opaque, veiled messages, impressions, and impulses from their dark patron and try to interpret them in the interests of the cult. They represent a connection between the worldly-organizational level of a cult and the metaphysical power in the background, serving as messengers and spiritual leaders to their cult.",

They are vicious predators who are dangerous when you see them, as they can unexpectedly cross surprising distances with mighty leaps, but infinitively more dangerous if you don\u0027t, as they excel at lurking in the shadows while waiting in their web, eager to strike as their prey becomes more and more entangled. Megaarachnids usually hunt alone or in small packs to take down bigger prey, but are also known to band together in vast colonies, occupying claustrophobic burrows or abandoned structures, creating a web-covered and egg-filled nightmare realm littered with the dried out husks of their victims.",

Crownbreakers live to fight for the top of the food chain, tirelessly working their way from territory to territory, domain to domain, tirelessly challenging the rulers of those realms - be they other wyverns, chimeras, giants or even true dragons. Through physical strength, raw aggression, and ceaseless savagery alone, these colossal Arch-Wyverns manage to triumph over opponents that seem many times more powerful than their challengers. With each victory, the Arch-Wyvern emerges stronger, and with each triumph, it comes closer to its goal of absolute martial dominance.",

When met with unreasonableness or hostility, the Debt Collectors begrudgingly change tactics in favour of more direct means of apprehension.

This lead to the development of the Sword Guardian, a more nimble, albeit less hardy construct that excels at close quarter combat. Their combat tactics can be switched at a moment\u0027s notice, making them both capable bodyguards and assertive enforcers. While their stiff movements appear predictable, incautious opponents often find themselves blocked in by an unending barrage of precise Greatsword blows. Like their defensive brother-constructs, they are valuable assets for wizards in need of some artifical muscle or wealthy merchants looking for an effective deterrent.",

Decried as carriers of bad omen, death and evil magic, they have been hunted to near extinction. The remaining Harpyies prefer to nest on storm-wreathed cliffsides and within coastal ravines, seeking safety in isolation. Legend has them born from wind and water, which might explain their affinity to the sea. Colonies, or *parliaments*, of Harpyies can be often found nesting atop the salt-encrusted masts and rigging of beached shipwrecks. This behaviour unfortunately further feeds the hate and fear towards them, as they stand accused of gloating over the misfortune of others, when in reality Harpyies are inclined to protect shipwrecked sailors from actual malicious creatures like the alluring Sirens.",

What started started out as controlled, if experimental, cultivation has spiraled into an ecological disaster, as the Mawblooms evolved an unintended reproducive method by producing so-called Creeplings. The miniature Mawblooms are capable of uprooting themselves and crawl on unnerving root-legs, extending their reach to explore new territories. Their rapid colonization has led to ecological havoc, as they multiply exponentially, choking out native flora and preying upon local fauna.",

This crust acts both as natural armor, as well as a rich source of nutrients for nearby flora and fauna.

Dollmakers are craven creatures, relying on networks of worshippers or debtors to protect it, while it stalks nightly streets for fresh dolls.",

They maintain the moral of the troops by conducting bonding rituals and are generally tasked with a wide array of ceremonial duties. Even though they are feared and respected, Shamans often are outsiders, as their reclusive nature and connection to the spiritual world warps them into capricious eccentrics. Most Shamans are not bound to any host, as their true loyalty lies with the shamanistic covens they belong to, often only supporting a host chief when their reign of terror furthers the Shamans own, often concealed, agenda. In combat, Shamans are fearsome opponents who may call upon forces of nature to bring their enemies to their knees. They are able to call upon aid from beyond the grave and inspire the troops surrounding them to fight even harder, as they feel their ancestor\u0027s gaze upon them.",

These prototypes were expanded upon by military scientists and now serve as sentries and boarding repellents on various airships throughout the realms. Their armaments consist of heavy boarding axes, short-ranged ocular beams and advanced kinetic shielding, all powered by a miniature techno-arcane reactor. These sentries are able to activate a magnetic field, allowing them to safely battle any threats while being mag-locked to an airship\u0027s metal hull. Gunner variants are also known to operate the heavy Thunderstrike Pattern Airship Cannons utilized by great military airships, such as the Dawn Emperor and Storm Herald class.",

Due to their natural curiosity, they often find their way into the mundane world through rifts and gaps between planes, where they eagerly interact with its inhabitants. The danger posed by Satyrs is not immediately apparent - their inherent fey magic can plunge mortals into a state of intoxication that leads them to dissolve into a state of hedonistic ecstasy, losing their awareness of place and time before collapsing from exhaustion. Additionally, the satyric temperament can become increasingly unpredictable as the festivities approach their climax, and not infrequently, under the influence of intoxicating substances, the otherwise amicable and sociable creatures reveal their unpredictable and alien fey nature.",

The entire fleet vanished under mysterious circumstances without firing a single shot while traversing the waters near the Bleak Reef. Now, deprived of her baptism of fire and somehow salvaged from her watery grave, this mass of barnacles and iron is suffused with the vengeful thoughts of the ship, captain, and crew. It thirsts for the scent of gunpowder and the shattering of planks, with vengeful energies coalescing within this magnificent weapon, ready to unleash hell even as its wood remains in a continuous state of rot and its once polished metal is thick with rust. A magnificent heavyweight of an enemy for any hard-hitting maritime encounter!",

This phenomenon can occur through enchantment magic, ancient rituals, or more rarely, the awakening of the blade itself.

Some of these blades are tasked with guarding treasure chambers or wizards\u0027 studies, while others tirelessly roam the the tombs and castles of their long-forgotten masters.",

Most of them are hundreds of years old, and their gaze discerns patterns and causalities that remain hidden to most. Thus, they assume various roles, from saviors to destroyers, to steer the course of history in a way that aligns with their own nature. Characteristic of Azure Dragon-Sages is the pursuit of freedom for all peoples, and their arrival often heralds revolution and reformation. Some act as advisors, being able to foretel the future by discerning cloud patterns, some as elite instructors or even military leaders, their troops marching to the drum-beat of distant thunder.",

A well trained and experienced War-Troll is truly dangerous, as it knows to efficiently apply its devastating strength to crush its enemies with ease.",

Into this ash-choked realm of red sand and molten rock retreated the primordial beings of flame once the immense magic potential necessary to feed them slowly bled from the young world\u0027s bones into the beings of flesh and blood that slowly came to inhabit and shape it. The Manifestations are personified elemental forces, fire\u0027s unsatiable hunger and destructive nature given flickering form. In the profane world, Manifestations flock to places connected to their native plane or appear in the wake of fire-related disasters powerful enough to tear through the veil between planes.",

The leading theory proposes that a Wizard sought a way to secure his riches and enchanted a chest to simply make it come alive and eat intruders, which, knowing wizards, does not seem too far-fetched. How we ended up with the voracious ambush predators taking all manner of shapes or for ms still poses some unanswered questions. Similarly, unclear is how Mimics reproduce, even if the thought of pocket-sized chests with big eyes is delightful. Some theorize that Mimic eggs eerily resemble gold coins, allowing Mimics to mix their brood into the treasures they guard.",

Dwarves are a proud and stubborn folk and while they appreciate the rigid structures of monarchy, they need a reason for why a specific individual should hold the power to rule the grand cave cities, vast mountain halls and stalwart hill fortresses of dwarvenkind. However, if an aspirant to the throne manages to endure the ordeals and rites necessary to claim the title of king, their subjects serve them with unwavering loyalty. Each Dwarven King is a statesman, general and master craftsman with a body of granite, a soul of iron and a heart of gold.",

However, encounters with one of the rare specimens that have grown to gigantic size are not only unpleasant but deadly. Anyone who thinks they can avoid these toothy ambush predators by dismissing their glowing lure as unappealing should be warned that those large, man-eating specimens have grown so big precisely because they know exactly how to lure those who venture into such inhospitable depths with the promise of rich rewards. And thus, many an experienced luremaw no longer dangles a typical glowing lure, but rather a bulging treasure chest or similarly enticing artifacts, while its massive body remains hidden in darkness or buried in the seabed.",

First and foremost, because one should never cross someone with unfettered access to their food, the key to any room and a selection of thoroughly confirmable alibi. Likewise, most hospitality workers are just waiting for the chance to truly let off some steam and you should make sure not to be on the receiving end. However, the Barmaid knows the fate she has chosen, and if she truly despised the hustle and bustle, she\u0027d probably find a different job, for example Warlord or Grand Inquisitor.",

These experts in infernal occultism are known as Invocators, often traveling the planes in search of new insights and eagerly sharing their cruel knowledge. Within the infernal legions, they act as skilled spellcasters and summoners, always keen to apply their research and test their abilities against enemy spellcasters - of course after ensuring that the game is rigged in their favour.",

Most goblins are used to fight creatures larger than them and they make the most of it, trying to swarm enemies to bring them down, where their eponymous crooked blades are waiting. Goblins aren\u0027t eager to die fighting, as each dead goblin weakens the tribe. This utilitarian view on survival has earned them a reputation of cowardice, but if Goblins commit to a fight, they do so without hesitation, fully aware of their mortality and knowing that their death will only empower the raid, as their Shaman draws great strength from them.",

The fully grown Gorgeworm, driven mad by hunger, then burrows through the earth, devouring everything that falls within the reach of its scythe-like mandibles. Though tenacious prey may escape from the worm\u0027s gullet, they are often left with a Broodspawn attached, an undulating egg sac from which the asexually produced offspring of the worm hatch.",

Hardened veterans and master craftsmen, they operate and fight in the most adverse conditions, often deployed during sieges or subterranean conflicts. Battle-Masons do not settle for just clearing a tunnel or capturing an enemy position. Materials are reinforced, equipment is set up instantly, and a position is only vacated when it is in better condition than when it was captured. Stern and steadfast, they are the reliable force to turn to in times of crisis, offering expertise in high-pressure environments.",

The Shepherds are fiercely protective of their flock and possess extensive mycotic networks, constantly providing them with information about their environment.",

Almost every human culture has a being with the shared traits of a snake-like body, mighty wings, supernatural cunning and indomitable might. In some myths and folktales they are benevolent and wise, in most they are cruel and despotic. Our dragon makes no attempt at being an ambivalent creature, skirting the border of good and evil or trying to paint the picture of a complex and often misunderstood creature. This dragon is a scaled tyrant, a megalomaniacal lizard corrupted by the arcane energies flowing through its veins. It is avaricious, gluttonous, wrathful and treacherous - the worst traits humanity can offer, but enabled by inhabiting a body of a living and breathing natural disaster.",

They live a symbiotic lifestyle, residing in clusters called regiments, and often engage in battles for other creatures in exchange for sustenance. This mutual relationship has raised questions about a possible feralization from a previously domesticated state. Typically, these agreements involve the Crawlers defending hives, dens, or even villages in exchange for food resources from their employers. This strategic approach secures their survival while allowing them to utilize their specialized defense mechanisms as living artillery.",

Despite their turtle-like appearance, they appear to be an evolutionary offshoot of semi-aquatic sharks. Their thick leathery skin mirrors the swamp-green of their habitat and their cragged shells and bone protrusions become eventually overgrown by moss, algae and lichens, making Shattermaws surprisingly difficult to notice. Their diet consists of everything unlucky enough to wander in front of its eponymous maw, supplemented by anything barely resembling actual prey - including mossy logs, mid-sized boulders or small vehicles. This leads to swamps and river banks within Shattermaw territory being lined with the wreckage of skiffs or rafts displaying their signature corrosive bite marks.",
