They do this to take note of where this particular soul goes, to eventually drag it back to fulfill various purposes, should the need arise. Necessity is the mother of invention, goblins die in droves - why not capitalise on that? The goblins are thankful for their ancestor's service and both live and die knowing that their duty does not end in death. A Shaman's word carries a lot of weight, as they are known to converse with the spirits of the afterlife and carry the knowledge of the ancestors. Most shamans however quickly find out that dying does not automatically impart knowledge and most ancestors are as dense in death as they were in life. This realisation usually sours a Soulshaper Shaman's mood and factors into their characteristic bitterness.",

Most of them are hundreds of years old, and their gaze discerns patterns and causalities that remain hidden to most. Thus, they assume various roles, from saviors to destroyers, to steer the course of history in a way that aligns with their own nature. Characteristic of Azure Dragon-Sages is the pursuit of freedom for all peoples, and their arrival often heralds revolution and reformation. Some act as advisors, being able to foretel the future by discerning cloud patterns, some as elite instructors or even military leaders, their troops marching to the drum-beat of distant thunder.",

The most dangerous penitents, however, are those who underwent the purifications voluntarily, eager to shed the taint of witchcraft. They are the most unforgiving and zealous of their kind, hunting their tainted kin without mercy or remorse.",

Most Shamans are not bound to any host, as their true loyalty lies with the shamanistic covens they belong to, often only supporting a host chief when their reign of terror furthers the Shamans own, often concealed, agenda. In combat, Shamans are fearsome opponents who may call upon forces of nature to bring their enemies to their knees. They are able to call upon aid from beyond the Graves and inspire the troops surrounding them to fight even harder, as they feel their ancestor's gaze upon them.",

            "description": "Except as a carrier of disease, a single bat does not usually pose much of a challenge for both fledgling and seasoned adventurers. But add a few hundred or even thousand bats, and you're suddenly confronted with a shrieking inferno of razor claws and pointy teeth, able to gnaw any humanoid the meat from its bones by sheer mass of bodies. Now, regular swarms of bats normally don't show signs of aggression towards beings larger than their insect prey. But in a world steeped in dark magic and beset by evil forces, bats can become dangerous creatures, revelling in a vampiric nature normally only shown by a few select subspecies of bats. These bloodthirsty swarms of bats darken the moonlight sky with ominous intent and are said to only leave drained husks in their wake...",

Their thick leathery skin mirrors the swamp-green of their habitat and their cragged shells and bone protrusions become eventually overgrown by moss, algae and lichens, making Shattermaws surprisingly difficult to notice. Their diet consists of everything unlucky enough to wander in front of its eponymous maw, supplemented by anything barely resembling actual prey - including mossy logs, mid-sized boulders or small vehicles. This leads to swamps and river banks within Shattermaw territory being lined with the wreckage of skiffs or rafts displaying their signature corrosive bite marks.",

These prototypes were expanded upon by military scientists and now serve as sentries and boarding repellents on various airships throughout the realms. Their armaments consist of heavy boarding axes, short-ranged ocular beams and advanced kinetic shielding, all powered by a miniature techno-arcane reactor. These sentries are able to activate a magnetic field, allowing them to safely battle any threats while being mag-locked to an airship's metal hull. Gunner variants are also known to operate the heavy Thunderstrike Pattern Airship Cannons utilized by great military airships, such as the Dawn Emperor and Storm Herald class.",

Into this ash-choked realm of red sand and molten rock retreated the primordial beings of flame once the immense magic potential necessary to feed them slowly bled from the young world's bones into the beings of flesh and blood that slowly came to inhabit and shape it. The Manifestations are personified elemental forces, fire's unsatiable hunger and destructive nature given flickering form. In the profane world, Manifestations flock to places connected to their native plane or appear in the wake of fire-related disasters powerful enough to tear through the veil between planes.",

What started started out as controlled, if experimental, cultivation has spiraled into an ecological disaster, as the Mawblooms evolved an unintended reproducive method by producing so-called Creeplings. The miniature Mawblooms are capable of uprooting themselves and crawl on unnerving root-legs, extending their reach to explore new territories. Their rapid colonization has led to ecological havoc, as they multiply exponentially, choking out native flora and preying upon local fauna.",

            "description": "Wherever damp tunnel networks extend beneath sprawling cities, one can find those who have chosen the Undercity as their domain. Shunned by even the less human-like races due to their unsettling appearance and unsavory reputation, the parallel worlds beneath the great cities are often a realm of matted fur, gnashing teeth, and crooked blades. And if one takes a wrong turn in the tunnels, it's possible to find themselves confronted by a dozen pairs of yellow-gleaming eyes in the darkness.",

The Uvargandrs scaled hide is known to flake off or be shed by the creature itself, these Storm Scale Chunks discharging in further explosions as it goes, making combat against this violent beast even more disorienting and chaotic.",
