They do this to take note of where this particular soul goes, to eventually drag it back to fulfill various purposes, should the need arise. Necessity is the mother of invention, goblins die in droves - why not capitalise on that? The goblins are thankful for their ancestor's service and both live and die knowing that their duty does not end in death. A Shaman's word carries a lot of weight, as they are known to converse with the spirits of the afterlife and carry the knowledge of the ancestors. Most shamans however quickly find out that dying does not automatically impart knowledge and most ancestors are as dense in death as they were in life. This realisation usually sours a Soulshaper Shaman's mood and factors into their characteristic bitterness.",

It thirsts for the scent of gunpowder and the shattering of planks, with vengeful energies coalescing within this magnificent weapon, ready to unleash hell even as its wood remains in a continuous state of rot and its once polished metal is thick with rust.

Through physical strength, raw aggression, and ceaseless savagery alone, these colossal Arch-Wyverns manage to triumph over opponents that seem many times more powerful than their challengers. With each victory, the Arch-Wyvern emerges stronger, and with each triumph, it comes closer to its goal of absolute martial dominance.",

Almost every human culture has a being with the shared traits of a snake-like body, mighty wings, supernatural cunning and indomitable might. In some myths and folktales they are benevolent and wise, in most they are cruel and despotic. Our dragon makes no attempt at being an ambivalent creature, skirting the border of good and evil or trying to paint the picture of a complex and often misunderstood creature. This dragon is a scaled tyrant, a megalomaniacal lizard corrupted by the arcane energies flowing through its veins. It is avaricious, gluttonous, wrathful and treacherous - the worst traits humanity can offer, but enabled by inhabiting a body of a living and breathing natural disaster.",

They maintain the moral of the troops by conducting bonding rituals and are generally tasked with a wide array of ceremonial duties. Even though they are feared and respected, Shamans often are outsiders, as their reclusive nature and connection to the spiritual world warps them into capricious eccentrics. Most Shamans are not bound to any host, as their true loyalty lies with the shamanistic covens they belong to, often only supporting a host chief when their reign of terror furthers the Shamans own, often concealed, agenda. In combat, Shamans are fearsome opponents who may call upon forces of nature to bring their enemies to their knees. They are able to call upon aid from beyond the Graves and inspire the troops surrounding them to fight even harder, as they feel their ancestor's gaze upon them.",

Our Revenant Knight is a tribute to the fallen Order of the Silver Dragon and leans more heaviliy into the tragic nobility of an undead order of Dragon-sworn Knights, with the icy essence of Argynvost still clinging to their ruined armour, in a desperate attempt to shield them from harm even in death. The lingering soul of the Silver Dragon still permeates his brothers in arms, empowering them in dynamic and unique ways.",

Despite their harrowing appearance, Ossian Debt Collectors are courteous and sophisticated negotiators, blessed with the endless patience of the undead and prodigious language skills. When approaching a debtor, they initially aim on settling things amicably, politely asking the transient debtor to accompany them to the Ossian Bank to stand before the Tribunal. When met with unreasonableness or hostility, the Debt Collectors begrudgingly change tactics in favour of more direct means of apprehension. It is unclear if their skeletal appearance reflects a Collector's true being or if it only appears as such to their targets, combining two of the things mortals fear most: death and tax collectors.",

Their diet consists of everything unlucky enough to wander in front of its eponymous maw, supplemented by anything barely resembling actual prey - including mossy logs, mid-sized boulders or small vehicles.

Due to this feature, Gobblers have almost no natural predators, causing them to generally act carefree, curious and playful. This  makes them even more dangerous, as Gobblers fearlessly seek out the company of other beings to play with them - oftentimes accidently killing them in the process.  Some assume the toxiCity to be a result of the Gobbler's diet, raising the question on what on earth Gobblers are eating.",

Bog Striders are attracted to their prey by ripples in the murky water, using their front legs as sensors for the vibrations. The Bog Strider aims to puncture its prey's body with its proboscis and injects acidic saliva that liquifies the innards, sucking out the resulting fluid. Due to their low intelligence and high dependency on pheromonal markings, they can be controlled with special pheromonal cocktails, making them ideal mounts for traversing wetlands.",

Over time fanatical members of the Reanimator Conclave seemingly discerned sentience within their own devices, remnants of the soul-lightning powering them.

The surrounding realms where powerless against the god-beasts otherworldly might and divine wrath and soon an empire was carved from bone, blood and sand with mighty monuments of worship rising from the desert ground wherever the slave-armies of Ankh marched. The god-beasts were cast down using the cthonian Duat Blades, their wielders were lauded as heroes and ruled Ankh for ages, their lifespan unnaturally extended by the cursed blades. As they eventually died, they would rise again and reclaim their blades, their embalmed and mummified bodies serving as hollow vessels for the energies of the Duat. Legions of shambling mummies follow in their wake, once more called to war by their queens and princes, now waging war on their own erstwhile kin-blood.",

What started started out as controlled, if experimental, cultivation has spiraled into an ecological disaster, as the Mawblooms evolved an unintended reproducive method by producing so-called Creeplings. The miniature Mawblooms are capable of uprooting themselves and crawl on unnerving root-legs, extending their reach to explore new territories. Their rapid colonization has led to ecological havoc, as they multiply exponentially, choking out native flora and preying upon local fauna.",

Known as the Jungle Monarch in the indigenous xotl language, this colossal predator embodies an ancient and fearsome majesty that evolution wasn't able to improve upon. Its thunderous footfalls reverberate through the foliage, conjuring images of bygone eras of lost worlds and untamed wilderness. Its towering form and menacing maw evoke the very essence of raw, untamed nature, a prehistoric force that roams the land, instilling a sense of ancient danger and primal instincts in all who dare to wander these unforgiving territories.",

This mutual relationship has raised questions about a possible feralization from a previously domesticated state.

Some Gnolls display a targeted savagery that surpasses mere hunger; and, under the watchful gaze of their demonic progenitor, they are driven to hunt for increasingly grand prey. Every battle becomes a personal pursuit for trophies, and soon, only the flesh of elite warriors or pack alphas can momentarily sate their all-consuming hunger.",

But as long as their bones haven't been ground to dust and their flesh hasn't fully withered, they keep on, shambling, crawling and creeping forwards at the behest of their dark masters, compensating their lack of redeeming qualities with sheer numbers and their indisputable tenacity. Often, these deplorables band together into hordes, descending upon living beings like waves of withered flesh and missing limbs.",

It is common for a mature Carnax to seek an equal opponent in battle and, should they prove worthy, submit to them, forming a martial bond in and out of combat, mutually learning from one another as battle brothers, mutuals and mounts. Warriors able to forge such a bond with a Carnax often attain legendary renown, and the power of such a mighty ally often allows them to naturally or violently rise to the top of their respective hierarchical structures.",
